# HotBirdFloodPredictionModel
Over 2.3 Billion people are affected due to floods in last 20 years and causing countless death.
More than 92 million cattle are lost every year, seven million hectares of land is affected, and damage is over 
trillions dollars when taken globally in last 5 years. Floods are complicated natural events. 
It depends on several parameters, so it is very difficult to model analytically. 
The floods in a catchment depends on the characteristics of the catchment, rainfall and antecedent conditions.
So the estimation of the flood peak is a very complex problem.  Its due to the lack of Flood Prediction 
System which can predict the situation accurately. 
To Overcome this challenge we are building a Flood Prediction System using Predictive modelling. 
However we have divided our idea into small fragments but enough to be used globally.
We have considered most flooded state of India that is Bihar, but can be used widely for all the low lying geographical regions.
